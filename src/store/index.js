        postContents: "<p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>A listing in an online directory can be of tremendous value to businesses large and small.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Websites that serve as online directories list a variety of useful information (services provided, contact information, etc.) that help paying customers find you and your business. They are kind of like a glorified phonebook -- only <strong>way better.</strong></p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>There are a number of serious benefits to having your business listed in such an online directory. Here are just a few.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Advertise your business</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>The simplest and most obvious reason your business should be listed in an online directory is that it is one more way to advertise your business. A listing in an online directory is one more way to capture the attention of potential customers.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>And, it is a more <strong>effective</strong> way to advertise your business than traditional advertising. That is because -- unlike paid advertisements that appear on websites in an annoying and haphazard way -- your future customers are already looking for your services.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>For example, your future patrons are already searching Google for things like 'chiropractors in Los Angeles' and finding their way to these online directories. If you have a listing in an online directory, the chances they find their way to your business are <strong>significantly</strong> increased.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Boost your SEO</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Search Engine Optimization, or SEO for short, is basically a way to get the eyes of <strong>more</strong> and <strong>better</strong> potential clients on your website. That means you want more of it.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>More specifically, SEO means doing things <strong>on</strong> and <strong>for </strong> your website to get it to rank higher up on search engines like Google.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Now, there is a lot that goes into boosting SEO.But simply put, the <strong>external links</strong> (links on other websites that point to your website) from listings in an online directory are great for SEO.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Get more website traffic</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Are your potential customers trying to find you by flipping through the pages of a phonebook? Probably not.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Most of your potential customers are trying to find your services on the Internet.Naturally, a listing in an online directory can provide a boost to your website traffic. That means <strong>more exposure</strong> and <strong>more visibility.</strong></p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Take control of your business image</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>This is arguably the most significant benefit of listing your business in an online directory.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Having your business listed in an online directory provides a natural reassurance to your potential clients.When they see your business listed by a third party, it lends a higher degree of <strong>legitimacy</strong> and <strong>trust</strong> to your business and its services.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>What's more, some online directories allow you to customize the information in your listing. For example, you can often write your own description of services offered.This helps get the <strong>right</strong> customers to your website and through your door.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Some online directories even perform (or require) reviews of your services.Some will even post customer testimonials. The point is: with a listing in an online directory <strong>you can take control of your business image.</strong></p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Keep costs low</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>The icing on the cake is that a listing in an online directory usually doesn't cost that much.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Most online directories provide listings for only a small fee. The cost of a listing in an online directory largely depends on what kind of services your business provides.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>For example, the cost of listing an attorney with a nationwide business is far more expensive than that of a chiropractor in a small town. Most of the time, this fee can be as small as <strong>$100, $50, or even $25 per month.</strong></p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>The simple fact, though, is that a small monthly fee for a listing in an online directory can provide a <strong>ton</strong> of value. And that makes it <strong>cheap.</strong></p>",

        postContents: "<p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>The Netlify platform seeks to '<a href='https://www.netlify.com/' target='_blank'>build the future of the web</a>' by providing what they call 'an entire ecosystem of modern tools and services into a single, simlpe workflow for building high performance sites and apps.' <strong>This is great news for software developers and web site designers</strong>.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>The beauty of the Netlify platform is that it truly provides the developer's dream. Essentially, it allows developers to <a href='https://www.netlify.com/products/' target='_blank'>'just write code</a>.' Here are a number of ways that the Netlify platform does this and makes their platform a great choice for building, deploying, and more.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Used by major companies</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>The simple fact is: you don't have to take my word for it.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>A number of major companies have integrated the Netlify platform into their operations. <a href='https://www.netlify.com/customers' target='_blank'>Netlify's Customer Stories</a> page details a number of customer testimonials that include high praise of the platform.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Netlify's customers include major companies such as <strong>Verizon</strong>, <strong>Nike</strong>, and <strong>Peloton</strong>. And its many testimonials discuss benefits such as <strong>blazing fast speed, significant cost-reduction, and more.</strong></p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>In other words, a lot of companies have chosen and love Netlify. Not just me.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Great for Single Page Applications (SPAs)</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Netlify is designed to work with <a href='https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/' target='_blank'>Jamstack architecture</a> -- in other words, the JavaScript, APIs, and Markup technology stack. This architecture means building, deploying, and maintaining beautiful and high-performing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application' target='_blank'>Single Page Applications</a> is <strong>incredibly easy</strong>.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>I personally prefer using the Vue.js front-end framework for designing websites. Fortunately, <a href='https://www.netlify.com/with/vue/' target='_blank'>Netlify makes working with Vue.js extremely easy.</a> But Netlify also works with a number of other technologies and frameworks. So if you prefer, <a href='https://www.netlify.com/with/wordpress/' target='_blank'>Netlify can integrate with WordPress</a> too.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Automated building via GitHub</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>One of my favorite features of the Netlify platform is the ability to connect your Netlify-hosted app to any repository in your GitHub account. Netlify's tagline '<a href='https://www.netlify.com/products/build/' target='_blank'>Push to Git, and that's it</a>' is no exaggeration.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>All you have to do is connect your Netlify deployment process with your Git repository. After you run your 'git push' command, Netlify automatically recognizes the updates and begins its deployment process to make your work go live.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>It can be as simple as that. You can also <strong>customize your deployment process</strong> as your project's needs dictate. Build commands, publish directories, deployment scripts, and more can be customized however you wish.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Speed and Performance</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'><a href='https://www.netlify.com/customers' target='_blank'>Netlify's Customer Stories</a> and testimonials represent an accurate depiction of the speed and performance that the platform offers.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>One reason that Netlify-hosted applications are so fast is because of <a href='https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/' blank='_blank'>Netlify Edge.</a> It represents a global network of prerendered projects that renders having <strong>your own Content Delivery Network (CDN) totally unnecessary.</strong></p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Another reason Netlify has such great speed and performance is because of the technologies it supports and integrates with. The <a href='https://jamstack.org/' target='_blank'>Jamstack architecture</a> that Netlify enables is <strong>literally built for speed</strong>.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Integration with forms</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Another of my favorite features of the Netlify platform is the ability to <strong>seamlessly integrate with website forms</strong>.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>For example, you can <strong>quickly and easily set up a contact form</strong> for your website without all the extra overhead of server-side code, JavaScript, or a database. <a href='https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/' target='_blank'>Netlify forms</a> take care of everything behind the scenes.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'><a href='https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/' target='_blank'>Netlify forms</a> also automatically include a number of features such as <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/forms/spam-filters/#extra-spam-prevention' target='_blank'>spam prevention</a> and protection against bots. And, you can even add <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/forms/spam-filters/#recaptcha-2-challenge' target='_blank'>reCAPTCHA 2 challenges</a> to your forms.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Security</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Online security is a major concern in an age when cyber attacks are all too common. That's why <a href='https://www.netlify.com/security/' target='_blank'>Netlify security</a> is so handy. You can <strong>literally do nothing extra</strong> beyond deploying your project on Netlify and rest assured that you are getting boosted security.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Among the many benefits of <a href='https://www.netlify.com/security/' target='_blank'>Netlify security</a> are: active Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) mitigation, encryption of all network traffic over Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol -- meaning <strong>everything is HTTPS</strong> -- and regular penetration testing performed on the platform's network infrastructure.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>And, you can do even more to secure your application, including <strong>user authentication</strong> with <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/' target='_blank'>Netlify Identity.</a></p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Pricing</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Yet another of my favorite features of the Netlify platform is its pricing structure.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'><a href='https://www.netlify.com/pricing/' target='_blank'>Netlify pricing</a> includes three clearly defined and priced tiers, in addition to a customized Enterprise tier for the largest of operations. Why do I love their pricing so much? Because Netlify has a <strong>free Starter tier</strong> that is <em>actually free</em>.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>I have been able to deploy a number of high-quality, fast, and secure applications through Netlify's platform without paying a dime. And in the case that I need more, the Pro tier is a wonderfully low-priced <strong>$19.99 / month</strong>.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Documentation</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>As a software developer and website designer, I know the frustrations of having to deal with platforms and APIs that are not well-documented. That is why I love <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/' target='_blank'>Netlify's documentation</a> so much.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>I have been able to find official <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/' target='_blank'>Netlify documentation</a> that <strong>covers every feature or issue</strong> I have had questions about in enough, but not too much, detail.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Furthermore, because <strong>Netlify is widely utilized</strong>, finding even more environment- and project-specific support is incredibly easy using search engines like Google.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>All the extras</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Netlify has <strong>so many other features and integrations</strong> on its platform that it is impossible to capture them adequately in this one post. But, just to name a few others that you might be interested in, Netlify also offers:</p><ul class='list-disc'><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://zapier.com/apps/mailchimp/integrations/netlify' target='_blank'>easy integration with Mailchimp via Zapier</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'>analytics data via <a href='https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/' target='_blank'>Netlify Analytics</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.netlify.com/for/ecommerce/' target='_blank'>support for e-commerce</a>, including integration with Stripe payments</li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'>serverless functions via <a href='https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/' target='_blank'>Netlify functions</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'>integrations with Content Management Systems (CMS)</li></ul><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>For all those reasons and more, I believe <strong>the Netlify platform is a simple, fast, and secure platform for developers</strong> of all experience levels.</p>",

        postContents: "<p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Some of the best branding and designing often goes unnoticed--not because it is done poorly, but because it is done <em>well</em>. It is worth taking a closer look at some color schemes popular in website design, precisely because they can be so important and effective.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Why Colors Are Important</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>A good color scheme is pleasing to the eyes and attractive to viewers. This much is obvious.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>But a <em>great</em> color scheme also does so much more. An effective color scheme <strong>reinforces company image</strong> and <strong>evokes certain emotions</strong> in the viewer.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>So, let's briefly discuss some commonly utilized color schemes for website design.</p><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Standard Color Schemes</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Among the most common color schemes prevalent on the Internet include: blue, green, and a combination of black, white, and grey.</p><h3 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Blue</h3><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Blue color schemes are very common in modern website design. Shades of blue and its complementary colors tend to evoke <strong>feelings of trust and calm</strong>. Blues can also promote a <strong>feeling of higher intellect and authority</strong>.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>So, the emotions that blue color schemes evoke lend themselves well to businesses where calm and trust are desired, such as healthcare, finances, and technology.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Here are a few examples of some websites using a blue color scheme:</p><ul class='list-disc'><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://zoom.us/' target='_blank'>Zoom</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.americanexpress.com/' target='_blank'>American Express</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.walmart.com/' target='_blank'>Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Green</h3><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Green color schemes often evoke <strong>feelings of being natural and healthy</strong>. They also naturally make us think of <strong>finances and money</strong>.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Green color schemes are therefore appropriate for business involved in finances, foods (especially natural and organic), and health.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Here are a few examples of some websites using a green color scheme:</p><ul class='list-disc'><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://mint.intuit.com/' target='_blank'>Mint</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.shopify.com/' target='_blank'>Shopify</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.instacart.com/' target='_blank'>Instacart</a></li></ul><h3 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>Black, White, and Gray</h3><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Another standard color scheme is a combination of black, white, and gray. These colors often imbue the viewer with <strong>feelings of being classy and sophisticated</strong>.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Black, white, and gray color schemes are great for authoritative and up-scale branding. These colors support a company image of being modern, fancy, high-quality, expensive (or more nicely put, valuable), and chic.</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Here are a few examples of some websites using black, white, and gray color schemes:</p><ul class='list-disc'><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.apple.com/' target='_blank'>Apple</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.verizon.com/' target='_blank'>Verizon</a></li><li class='mb-4 ml-6 leading-6'><a href='https://www.nike.com/' target='_blank'>Nike</a></li></ul><h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-12 mb-4 text-gray-600'>What Are Your Colors?</h2><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Given all we've discussed, what are your colors? What is the color scheme that supports your brand? Which colors will evoke the desired emotions in your website's visitors?</p><p class='mb-4 leading-relaxed'>Think about it. It's important.</p>",
